Thank you A R Irwin Violins! You’ve done an amazing job with cleaning up and repairing all the cracks and bumps in my 1920’s German Violin.

A rehair, a re-polishing, a clean up and all the mess I’ve accumulated over the past decade is now gone! It’s a renewed pleasure to play. Looking forward to some upcoming symp and musical gigs.

Recommending A R Irwin Violins!
