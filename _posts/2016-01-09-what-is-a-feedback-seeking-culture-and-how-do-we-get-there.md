Here's a research project I'd love to do.

- How do we more accurately assess an individual's ability to handle feedback? 
- What are the steps towards feedback seeking maturity?

> "Handling feedback well is all about being more responsive to the information we receive about our environment and ourselves."

I see four categories that apply to all of us in our various organisations, projects, partnerships, friendships, communities and families.

Where do you sit on this feedback seeking maturity model?

### The four stages to feedback seeking maturity.

Each of these stages is a huge leap forwards and requires a lot of training and work to progress.

#### Stage 1. Silence

We all start here.

> "I'm not willing to get involved and speak my mind because..."

Silence is our first and last refuge.

#### Stage 2. Giving

Giving is a baby step.

> "Hi Sally. We really need to catch up and talk about..."

When things become uncomfortable we try to "give" feedback. Setting up situations in which we can frame a conversation around sending a clear signal is hard.

#### Stage 3. Receiving

Receiving is a sign of maturity.

> "I hear what you are saying and I am able to take it on-board whole heartedly."

Receive feedback without getting caught up in triggers, boundaries, displacement, identity, truth, perspective and tracks is a big challenge. This takes significant training.

#### Stage 4. Seeking

Seeking is progressive.

> "Tell me, what is the one thing holding me back from being a better partner / colleagues / friend / son / parent / ...? Let's actually talk."

A feedback seeking culture is one in which we communicate with authenticity and respond with improved agility.

This takes a lot of modelling, leadership, safety and maturity. We must learn how to seek feedback.

Maintaining a feedback seeking culture takes a lot of work.
