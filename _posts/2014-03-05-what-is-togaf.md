*   [The Open Group Architecture Framework](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework)

Working in IT can be a challenge. At times it can be monotonous, repetitive, endless, complicated, stressful and full of unexpected problems. Especially when it comes to actually writing code and building functionality and then setting it free.

These issues are in sharp focus at all stages of a project, even it’s design phase. To help structure the discussion right from the start a design methodology can help.

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is a framework for enterprise architecture which provides a comprehensive approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise information architecture.

The over arching TOGAF discussion involves separating out different elements of the project into 4 separate Domains.

1.  Business Architecture.
2.  Application Architecture.
3.  Data Architecture.
4.  Technology Architecture.

This separation is arbitrary. This methodology is arbitrary. The point is, it’s an approach that many people can use to work together.

TOGAF was established in the early 1990s. In 1995 TOGAF 1.0 was further developed of a learnings made in the US Department of defence. Basically, TOGAF has military roots.

This approach to architecture design structures the conversation by identifying Principles. Each Domain has a list of Principles. Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission.

A Principle is made up of the following attributes.

1.  Name. Easy to remember.
2.  Statement. Communicate the fundamental rule.
3.  Rationale. Highlight business benefits.
4.  4\. Implications. Highlight Requirements.

This methodology helps structure a given project. It helps ensure progress. It helps make building a solution more interesting.

People get confused. Teams get into disagreements. TOGAF Principles help direct and resolve differences of opinion.
