Being with Thomas, Isabel, friends and family at the Glebe Cafe Church last night was quite amazing.

This concert was not like your regular fall-to-sleep-same-old classical music concert. These musicians look at one another when they play. These musicians talk!

I’m determined to find a way to help connect this sort of outstanding live musician collective with a local audience – there must be 1000’s of classical music fans who live in the area that would have simply loved this event. This was the best thing on show in Glebe last night, I’m sure of it!

I’m looking forward to seeing you at the next Thomas Talmacs new works and arrangements concert!
