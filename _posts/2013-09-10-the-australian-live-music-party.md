Now that we have two new micro parties for ‘sport’ and ‘cars’ in our national parliament, how about we get cracking on a ‘Live Music Party’ for the next election?

**The Australian Live Music Party**  
“A passionate group of community driven musicians and friends who believe live music is paramount.”

Music teachers, students, professionals, amateurs, venues, artists.. unite! Together we can pull down unnecessary red tape restrictions, counter-cultural national policy and give rise to a new exciting social fabric founded on a renewed love of live local art – for all. You in?

Make your mark on the map of live music and let’s get cracking!
