Here’s what I learnt from my first day @Readify Sydney.

> If Batman worked in IT he’d be a consultant.

Today I started with Readify. I was lucky enough to get through the extensive interview process over the past few weeks.

It’s great to feel like the dumbest person in the room again.

## The Schedule

Attending meetings, discussing ideas, picking up new gear, client assignment. With eveything else going on today I’m surprised we fit all this in!

*   8:30am: Arrive and connect. Documentation. Skills matrix.
*   10:30am: Buddy introduction and initial support. Thank you for your very warm and supporting guidance. Coffee. A local cafe in Darlinghurst. The sunshine. I’ve got a lot to learn.
*   11:30am: Meet and great lead consultants. It’s interesting to meet a pair of well seasoned and talented Readify consultants. Guys who’ve been in the business for many years and know what they are looking for in a new recruit. These guys don’t waste any time. Suitability.
*   12:30pm: Lunch with People Management. A very friendly and encouraging lunch. More about what it means to join the team and work your magic. Structure. Progress. Development. Improvement. It takes a lot of patience to deal with over 100 hands on software developer nerds. These guys have a fresh approach.
*   2:30pm: Meet state management. Share skills. Team background. Direction. Travel stories.
*   3:30pm: Client assignment. Discussion on suitable clients and top secret high profile projects, seriously.
*   4:30pm: Spend some device allowance on a new Microsoft Surface Pro 3 at JB Hifi. Thanks Jarrad (jb hifi staff at town hall – awesome staff) for all your help with my new laptop! We (along with the guys at work via our internal social network) had a lengthy debate over the surface3, Lenovo Yoga Pro 2 and the new Macbook Pro. picking out a device is a great way to get device chatter flowing. thanks again for all your help guys.

## Meeting rooms and breakout

The Sydney office has limited space. When things get busy the local hipster cafes of darlinghurst suffice. It’s a win win. There’s something very open and inclusive about the way the Sydney Readify crew communicates.

## My first impressions

Readify is a fast paced, challenging, supportive, open and resourceful working environment.

I hope to do my best as a new Readifarian.
