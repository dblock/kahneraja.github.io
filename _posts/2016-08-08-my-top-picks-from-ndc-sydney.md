### Cristian Prieto: Javascript through history.

Javascript, the internet lingua franca. Many developers have embraced and love javascript, many hate it as a language. Why is inheritance handled in such a weird way? Why do I have to put 'strict' at the beginning of every script? What, there is no more ES6? What is this ES2017? What is Rhino and V8?

### Lars Klint: The Force Awakens: Mastering Your Inner Developer

It takes effort and discipline to be a great developer, but how do you know what to focus on, what to pursue, what to say no to? And how do you fit it all into an already packed life of family, friends, discovery and ambition?

### Gojko Adzic: The future of test automation

Processing is getting cheaper, software is getting more distributed and clouds are taking over. These trends will have a significant impact on what we can do with test automation and what will make sense to automate in the future. Prohibitively expensive testing strategies are becoming relatively cheap, and things that we didn’t even consider automating will become quite easy. At the same time, strategies that served us well for on-premise reliable hardware simply won't work for the distributed, fragmented, virtualised platforms.

### ​James Mickens: Life As A Developer: My Code Does Not Work Because I Am A Victim Of Complex Societal Factors That Are Beyond My Control And Do Not Involve My Own Laziness

> "What are the best practices for shipping high-quality software?" 

This question is an example of a question that I will not answer in my talk. Instead, I will describe why any software project that contains more than 10 lines of code is guaranteed to fail. Using my fragmentary knowledge of the laws of thermodynamics, I will explain why code is like a proton that must ultimately turn into a crystal or, uh, whatever it is that thermodynamics says will happen. I will demonstrate how unit tests, functional programming, and UML diagrams fail to address the primary source of software failure (namely, that software is an inherently bad idea because our brains evolved to hunt giant sloths with primitive stone tools, and MongoDB only partially resembles a giant sloth).

### Head to head wth Scott Allen, Jon Skeet & Scott Hanselman

Back with another Stack Overflow Question and Answer session - this time with K. Scott Allen going up against Jon Skeet. In this session, Scott Hanselman will select five questions from Stack Overflow pertaining to .NET and will send these questions to Scott and Jon a week before the talk.

Can't wait till next year!

# Offline discussions...

1. Meetings are stupid. Zero to one. Great companies are self organising. Scrum and agility is for amateurs.
2. 2 years consulting.2 years product dev. The ideal plan. Adopt a changing landscape. Grow.
3. Whats hard about technology? Naming. Caching. Searching.
4. Lars klint. Leverage. Cutting friends. Setting goals. Happiness. Being free. Letting go of what other people think.
5. Public speaking around a historical journey is fascinating!
6. Cloud functions. Changing the incentives. A new big step in the cloud paradigm.
7. .netcore is just nodejs stuff.
