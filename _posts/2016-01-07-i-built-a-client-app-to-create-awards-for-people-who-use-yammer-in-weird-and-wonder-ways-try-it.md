Do you use Microsoft's enterprise social network Yammer?

To get us started I've now puzzled together the following (slightly weird) prizes:

- Bang For Buck Award: Most engaging post in under 140 characters.
- Group Creator Award: Creator of most popular new group.
- I Like You Award: I hit like more than anyone else.
- Silent Assassin Award: I regularly login. I never post.
- Contributor Award: I get involved by posting and liking more than anyone else.
- Batman Award: I only ever post at night.

# How?

Pulling together 1000's of messages, users and groups into a single web browser isn't super easy.

I had to figure out the following:

- How do you **compress** all that yammer data into a browser window so it doesn't fall over?
- How do you **query large multi dimensional data sets** without a backend?
- How do you handle **authentication** and then host it so others can use it?

# Answers

React. Underscore. NPM. Gulp. Github pages.
