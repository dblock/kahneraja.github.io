I've been writing on wordpress now for over 10 years and I've finally decided to get cool and move to jekyll. 

## Cost and Load Time.

Here's why I even bothered looking into change.

1. AWS has started sending me $30AU/month bills to keep my wordpress site up and running.
2. Wordpress runs really slow. I literally have to "wait around" for the page to load.

Following that I've found a bunch of other nice things about Jekyll :)

## I'm a Developer. I like flexibility. I like Markdown.

The experience of publishing with wordpress is more suitable for journalists, content writers, basically anyone who doesn't enjoy code.

Working with Jekyll brings me close to the front end code and allows me to be a little more creative and efficient.

With a whole new world of distributed web technologies it's now quite a straight forward exercise to handle things like "membership", "ecommerce", "document store", and "data" via javascript connected services like UserApp, Firebase, Snicart, SendOwl and other things.

## How long did it take?

It took be a day to faff around the Jekyll's templating strategy and a day to migrate my wordpress content using various fun things like sublime group editing and powershell.

Two days.

Ths blog is now Jekyll generated and hosted on github pages.
