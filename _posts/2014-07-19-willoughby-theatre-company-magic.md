Yep, that’s exactly what we did. Concerts. We performed a series of 20 top hits from the magical world of musicals at the Concourse in Chatswood. The regular granny crowd.

One weekend. 3 shows. A stunning cast of soloists with full frontal drama. This crew do their best to push the limits. Performing with a vast choir, a stunning solo collective and a professional orchestra is a privilege.

The Concourse in Chatswood now holds a special place in my heart. We recently performed the Phantom of the Opera. In the dark, during the interval I got down on one knee. I raised a flower in one hand and a diamond ring in the other. I asked my Amanda.

“Will you marry me?” “Yes!”

We met playing violin 3 years ago.

It’s now been over a year since I started doing these musical gigs with the Willoughy Theatre Company. It’s a funny sort of hard, casual, aggressive, work horse, marching band, sort of vibe. For these gala concerts we’re up front and centre. Normally the crew is hidden away in a pit below the stage surrounded by candy wrappers.

More often than not I’m the only guy in the string section. Me and 5 girls. I used to love that. Now it’s just awkward and sort of boring.

For me, the highlight is always the voices. The singing talent is worth it. I enjoy listing to the soloists. Their voices are full of character. I enjoy the way a voice bounces off a violin.

This recent concert with “there’s no business like show business” and ended with “do you hear the people sing?”.

Having been cranking out tunes on my violin now for nearly 30 years it’s sometimes a challenge to get myself up and out to every single rehearsal and concert but in the end it’s joyous. Someone inevitably sheds a tear on the final curtain. Joy. Relief.

Mixing a classical music performance life with full time software development profession is a challenge.
