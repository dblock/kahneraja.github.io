*   [AGILE must be destroyed, once and for all](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/08/erik_meijer_agile_is_a_cancer_we_have_to_eliminate_from_the_industry/)
*   [Agile Is Dead (Long Live Agility)](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/)

Erik Meijer and Pragmatic Dave make an excellent point. Agile is dead.

> “It’s not Agile that sucks, and dragging programmers down. It’s the inability of programmers and business people to understand each other.”

In my opinion the process of methodically tracking progress and rendering metrics is misleading at best. It may have been useful in the construction industry. Soft tech moves far too quickly.

My favourite clients understand that build software is more akin to playing high stakes chess or football.

*   Adding extra people won’t necessarily help.
*   There is one goal.
*   You either win or lose.
*   There is little time for debate.
*   Everyone involved has an equally important role to play.

When it comes to the game of building software, you win when the game ends and the customer starts using your product.
