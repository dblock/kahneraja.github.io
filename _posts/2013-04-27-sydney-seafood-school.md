This is what a day at the Sydney Fish Markets Seafood School is like…

Arrive at 11am. Sit through a fairly impressive presentation where you’re shown you (in HD – LIVE) how to gut, prepare, marinate and cook prawns, squid, mussels and fish. It’s both incredible discusting and educational.

It’s not for the faint hearted. Don’t try it hung over.

Amanda and I were lucky enough to have been given a gift certificates for the 4hr BBQ Seafood course today and despite the grumbling-hung-over-birthday-lack-of-sleep-exhausted-mindset we arrived with, we had a great time. Thank you!!!!

**Who would I recommend the class to?**

I think it would be great for a team of 5 work friends. There’s lots of team work involved.
