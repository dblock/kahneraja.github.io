*   [Scrum Software Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))

I’m really interested in helping people work together. I’m blow away by how much time and money is wasted on technology. More often than not, like in every industry, friendship / gender & race create road blocks.

I found the following very private email a friend wrote to their manager…

<div class="simplePullQuote">

If a task has a high joy factor, does that mean the effort involved is reduced?

<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">Hi Boss,</span>_</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">I’m picking up some interesting SCRUM vibes.</span>_</span>  
<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">I’m also really interested in the process of sharing knowledge and sharing ‘joy’ tasks.</span>_</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">Interesting question.</span>_</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">Does a joy task affect the effort quantity? E.g. if a task has a high joy factor, does that mean the effort involved is reduced?</span>_</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">Here are some interesting questions..</span>_</span>  
<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">1\. How are tasks allocated?</span>_</span>  
<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">2\. How is ability taken into account?</span>_</span>  
<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">3\. How do we encourage knowledge sharing?</span>_</span>  
<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">4\. How do we share the interesting tasks?</span>_</span>  
<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">5\. Is it ok to race down after the scrum planning meeting and snatch up the best task?</span>_</span>  
<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">6\. How is task progression monitored and account for at the end of the year? If I do more tasks, does that mean I’ll be rewarded?</span>_</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">Interesting ideas. Would be great to get more insight into this.</span>_</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">Also. Might be interesting to ensure that people pick one task at a time? Rules of engagement?</span>_</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">I’ve been in a situation a number of time where I’ve had to wait for someone to complete a set of tasks. Holding back progress – which does equate to a loss of time rather than collaboration.</span>_</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">It’s an interesting challenge!</span>_</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">Regards,</span>_</span>  
<span style="color: #808080;">_<span style="font-size: small;">Your passionate team member.</span>_</span>

This conversation is fascinating. It’s interesting to think about team dynamics. About sharing and collaboration. About ability and confidence. About power and information. About knowing where all the keys to the castle are hidden.

A “first in best dress policy” might sound like a productive competitive model. Is it sustainable? Is it fair? Does it provide a progressive social framework in which a team of skilled professionals can engage with a business and it’s goals?

I have an opinion. I think 80% of projects fail because developers exist within frameworks that disable collaboration. Collaboration and open knowledge => businesses saving money.

Really looking forward to being a scrum master one day.
