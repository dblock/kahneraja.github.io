Leichhardt Espresso Chorus’s mid year concert on the weekend was a poetic, imaginative, ground breaking success. The concert explored the humour, wit and wisdom of Easops Fables. A beautiful collaboration of local community voice, puppetry, the Espresso Kids choir and up and coming local orchestral musicians.

Conceived and conducted by Michelle Leonard, the concert premiered a five movement suite by young composer Alice Chance; musings on a moral paradigm by composer David Basden and shadow puppetry by Clare Testoni.

> “We are excited about all the great success we’ve made over the past few years. The use of this great space ‘The Forum’ really is a blessing. Our audiences love it. Every year we break through barriers exploring new musical styles and spaces.”  
> – Michelle Leonard

Speaking with Michelle you get the sense that this choir is on the cutting edge of new choral music for all. In stark contradiction to the fumbling online digital music trade, this choir resonates with a successful fresh sense of live local music. Having established a strong and unique musical voice, they should be proud of what they have achieved. This choir knows how to draw on its local talent.
