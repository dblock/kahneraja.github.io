Very excited to have two of my works selected to be auctioned off at next weeks Wotton + Kearney & So They Can fund raising dinner.

The partnership will be taking a team of runners to Kenya. They will participate in the Maasai Mara half marathon. Aiming to raise enough funds to sponsor, educate and feed 80+ children through school.

In my work I attempt to explore the human form by looking at the judgements we form of ourselves and those around us. I hope to strip away some of these these layers to reveal a beauty we all share.
