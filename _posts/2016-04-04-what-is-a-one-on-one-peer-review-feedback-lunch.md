Let me start with a challenge.

Send two colleagues you work with on a regular basis the following email.

---
Subject: One on one peer review feedback lunch: {Their Name} & {Your name}.

Location: Nearby cafe.

Message:

Hi {Their Name},

Would you consider doing a fortnightly one on one peer feedback lunch sometime?

Wait. What exactly is a “one on one peer review feedback lunch" I hear you ask?

It’s an opportunity for two people to get some on-the-ground feedback in a open, honest and friendly forum.

A chance for us to have a two way conversation in private about three things.

1.	Your best moment. “I think your best moment since we last met was…”
2.	You worst moment. “I think your worst moment since we last met was…”
3.	Your focused improvement point. “Cool. So I totally get that you are trying to work on your ability to influence the strategy we are taking with project ABC. I’ll track you on that. Here’s what I’ve seen you do that helps or hinders that goal.”

I’ve ran these regular two way catch-ups with a bunch of colleagues on various projects and it’s been eye opening. 

To follow up, I tend to track our conversation in Trello. This helps generate a report of goals achieved including on the ground specific promotional material.

If you’d rather not – because it sounds creepy - then no problem. No hard feelings.

Thanks,
{Your name}

Copy and paste that and send it to someone now.

I believe that if everyone in a business sends this to two people it will lead on to a progressive agile fabric of open communication. This is at the heart of a culture based on a group of individuals.

## Learning to give and receive feedback.

What I've noticed about doing these lunches is that it's actually really hard to give and receive feedback.

More often than not it tends to start off with an awkward silence. A bit like a first date. It takes some getting used to. But, after a few sessions something changes, people start to become more comfortable with the format and begin to open up.

	Individual openness = Organisation agility = Profit.

Try it. Pass it on!
