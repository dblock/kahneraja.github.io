What is a "one on one peer review feedback lunch"?

One on one peer feedback lunch: {Their Name} & {Your name}

Send two colleagues you work with on a regular basis the following email.

Subject: One on one peer review feedback lunch: {Their Name} & {Your name}.

Location: Nearby cafe.

Message:

Hi {Their Name},

Would you consider doing a fortnightly one on one peer feedback lunch sometime?

Wait. What is a “One on one peer review feedback” session?

It’s an opportunity to get some on-the-ground feedback in a open, honest and friendly forum.

A chance for two people to have a two way conversation in private about:
1.	Your best moment. “I think your best moment since we last met was…”
2.	You worst moment. “I think your worst moment since we last met was…”
3.	Your focused improvement point. “Cool. So I totally get that you are trying to work on your ability to influence the client. I’ll track you on that. Here’s what I’ve see you do that helps or hinders that goal…”

I’ve ran these regular two way catch-ups with a bunch of colleagues on various projects and it’s been eye opening. 

To follow up, I tend to track our conversation in Trello. This helps generate a report of goals achieved and on the ground specific promotional material.

If you’d rather not – because it sounds creepy - then no problem. No hard feelings.

Thanks,
{Your name}

Copy and paste that and send it to someone now.

If everyone in a business sends this to two people it will lead on to a progressive agile fabric of open communication channels.

## Learning to give and receive feedback.

What I've noticed about doing these lunches is that it's actually really hard to give and receive feedback.

More often than not it tends to start off with an akward silence. A bit like a first date.

But after a few sessions something changes. People start to become more comfortable with the format and begin to open up.

Individual openness = Organisation agility and profit.

Try it. Pass it on!
