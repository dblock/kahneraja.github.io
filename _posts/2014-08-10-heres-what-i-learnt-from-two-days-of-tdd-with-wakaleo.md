### Wakaleo and John Smart

Wakaleo is John Smart. John Smart is a bdd / tdd expert. An academic. An author. A consultant. John can help you improve your organisations technology through improved bdd / tdd strategies, cleaner code and advanced continuous delivery.

You can find him online or at one of the upcoming ‘agile’ meetups in sydney, or melbourne.

### Techniques and Tools

His two day course involves a complex array of hands of labs involving; fluent assertions, tdd styles, various tools (NUnit, Jasmine, Specflow), advanced feature / specification definitions, real world prototyping, red green refactoring, test doubles (mocking), clean coding and refactoring.

Uncle bob would be proud.

### Testing Strategy

I left the course having learnt a lot and returned to work thinking about how some of these ideas weren’t so easy to implement.

The course helped me realise that organisation / architecture of a solution is important. Planning ahead. Putting together a testing strategy up front is incredibly important.

I’ve now got a better handle on a testing strategy for a multi layered web api service oriented architecture. A cleaner way to better organise Unit, Integration, Acceptance and Post Deploy tests.

> If you’re not carful. You’ll end up with a world of Acceptance Tests that are very difficult to maintain.
