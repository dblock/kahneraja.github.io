*   [Dave Grohl to give keynote speech at 2013 SXSW](http://www.salon.com/2012/11/16/dave_grohl_to_give_keynote_speech_at_2013_sxsw/)

> When I think about kids watching a TV show like American Idol or The Voice, then they think, ‘Oh, OK, that’s how you become a musician, you stand in line for eight fucking hours with 800 people at a convention center and… then you sing your heart out for someone and then they tell you it’s not fuckin’ good enough.’ Can you imagine?” he implores. “It’s destroying the next generation of musicians! Musicians should go to a yard sale and buy and old fucking drum set and get in their garage and just suck. And get their friends to come in and they’ll suck, too. And then they’ll fucking start playing and they’ll have the best time they’ve ever had in their lives and then all of a sudden they’ll become Nirvana. Because that’s exactly what happened with Nirvana. Just a bunch of guys that had some shitty old instruments and they got together and started playing some noisy-ass shit, and they became the biggest band in the world. That can happen again! You don’t need a fucking computer or the internet or The Voice or American Idol.

Every time I turn on the television and watch one of these music content television shows I’m blinded by the stunning economics of the whole thing. If it’s not judges drinking Cola or wearing certain brands it’s television networks ramming in as many ‘kid focused’ ads they can.

This stuff feels more like an extended advert break than anything to do with music or talent.

I’m convinced the solution to every musician’s woes is going to be solved by engaging a more local audience. And when I say local I don’t mean – in the same city. I mean, in the same neighbourhood / suburb / post code / zip code.

Every time I push this ‘neighbourhood audience’ band wage my colleagues bork.

Most communities in Sydney have literally 1000s of people seeking a live and local sound. I’m convinced a large percentage of this audience would absolutely love to pay $10 for a concert on a regular basis. $10 x ~500 once every two weeks >> $5000 >> in the community for musicians who live nearby. It’s an industry!

Seriously, how many musicians live within walking distance of where you live? How often do you see them perform within walking distance of where you live? ANYWAY – I can’t exactcly articulate what my vision is but… Just wait and see what happens with this Popup Concert idea I’ve been hacking away at recently.

I’m determined to proved that _neighbours_ have more cash for the average musician than television networks and record labels combined.
