On Sunday Apr 28 6:30pm, at The exclusive People’s Republic of Australasia, Jon Rose launched his extraordinary new book “The Music of Place”.

The event was celebrated with a introduction by Nick Shimmin (friend, venue manager and editor). John Davis (CEO of the Australian Music Centre) launched this new ground breaking paper with an empowering and historic speech. Robbie Avenaim, Joel Stern and Jon Rose performed a unique improvised performance in celebration.

“The Music of Place” has been published by Currency House – Platform Paper No. 35, with Preface by John Zorn.

On a very personally note – this event was the most intellectual and creative evening of music inspiration and conceptual development I’ve been to in years. The artistic expression and integrity of the performers and audience was profound. I felt lucky to be there!

The City of Sydney can often feel as thought it’s a cultural vacuum, but this collective of music veterans gives me hope. This group of old friends made me realise what is possible.

Nick Shimmin spoke about his life and love for the great work of Jon Rose. He recalled their first concert at the People’s Republic of Australasia and how, then as well as now, Jon Rose has been a force of energy they have all had to privilege to see through the years. Since it’s formation over 20 years ago it has remained a private, free and supportive venue for musicians in Sydney.

Me with my idol Jon Rose and the honourable John Davis at the People’s Republic of Australasia.

John Davis gave us all an amazing insight into his work as the CEO of the Australian Music Center and how Jon Rose has been an ongoing provoking inspiration through the years. “Why? Why not? What if?” is part of their dialog that has driven them to pursue a profession in music for nearly half a decade. John Davis recalls the piercing blue inspiration in Jon Roses’ eyes that just never lets up. “He drives all sorts of ground breaking creative projects. A wholistic landscape perspective. He’s an artist and a thinker who brings those ticking ideas and abstract spaces into reality.

The audience was a mix bag of baby boomers and young avant garde hipsters who, for the most part, felt privileged to be involved in something so unique and unpredictable. A lot of young new faces and a lot of old friendly faces – there was something very nostalgic about this event.

Jon Rose said a few brief words, he tends to let the music do the talking. He thanked the exclusive People’s Republic of Australasia manager – “Like all great things, they usually come down to one person’s drive and passion.”

The evening was brief. A few short speeches and then some music.

The music was the highlight. Using text to describe the sonic experience is to a large extent a waste of time, but here are a few ideas that might give you an impression.

The music was improvised. Jon Rose, Robbie Avenaim and Joel Stern playing together for the first time. Different ideas merging and fluctuating. Jon Rose briefly explained the setup – “Before you head towards the booze or door, let me explain that this is an evening of improvised music by a collective – it’s our first time playing together…”. An Electro + Drum kit + Violin ensemble performing in the most unexpected and unusual way. Scratching. Stomping. Turning. Upside down. Intricate. Playful. Masculine. Strong. Sliding a violin upside down along the floorboards.

This book launch was like no other and something I will surely remember for years to come.

It has been a privilege to have been given the opportunity to get to know Jon Rose over the past year and I’m now enjoying each page of his new book!

“Music’s social and spiritual values are now in question has we watch it being removed from the education curriculum with barely a murmur from students and parents.”  
(Jon Rose – The Music of Place).
