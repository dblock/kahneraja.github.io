This is the beginning of an IT sector revolution.

In the past software developers have played a solution focused role. They align with the character of an office worker. A business servant. This is about to change. Talented technically capable individuals are now holding up multinational corporations with the stroke of a key.

The dawn of the software developer celebrity has begun. Software has eaten the world, and the developers are doing all the eating.

Give them what they need. Get out of the way.

## Lionel Messi

Lionel Messi is a world famous footballer. Recently the rumour mill has gone into overdrive with reports that he wants to leave Barcelona following a fallout with coach Luis Enrique. Reports suggest that Messi commands a transfer fee of 200 million pounds and an annual salary of around 20 million pounds.

Lionel Messi is a player in demand, and he’s not the only one. There is a league for these sort of people. It’s called the Premier League and it drives the future of football around the world.

Lionel Messi is a high performance football individual.

## Sergey Shutka

Sergey Shutka is a world famous software developer. I work with him at Readify. He cuts code and drives teams. Recently the rumour mill has gone intro overdrive with reports that he may well be snatched up by one of the world largest web focused intergalatic business solutions provider. He commands 20 million pounds to crack open your source code. It’s a bargain.

Sergey Shutka is a player in demand, and he’s not the only one. There is a league starting to form around these sorts of people. It’s called the IT Premier League. It drives the future of software development.

Sergey Shutka is a high performance software developer individual.

## Give them what they need and get out of the way

High performance players work from the inside out. No schedules, calendars, back log items, scrum boards or burn down charts. No need for field managers or metrics.

It’s a game of competition, strategy and tactics in which individuals and small teams change the world.

## Building software ain’t easy.

Software is a complex endeavor. It is shaped by the human will. It is characterized by friction, uncertainty, fluidity, danger and disorder. While the nature of software is constant, it remains unpredictable, and is affected by a mix of physical, moral and mental factors. While software has the characteristics of both art and science, it is primarily shaped by human experience.
