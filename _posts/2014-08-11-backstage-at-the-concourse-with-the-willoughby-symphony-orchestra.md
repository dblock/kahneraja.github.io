Another weekend packed with concerns. The magical Willoughby Symphony at The Concourse in Chatswood. A #KidsYellingAtMusiciansInBowTies lunch time bonanza. Two powerful Russian Masters concerts. Our fearless leader, David Saffir.

Another amazing program at the hands of one of Sydney’s most loved international conductors, Nicolas Milton.

It’s quite an experience performing as a classical violinist in one of Sydney most successful community orchestra. It’s successful because it pulls an awesome crowd and brings the community together.

## Our soloist Ji Won Kim

Tchaikovsky: Violin Concerto in D major, op. 35.

Ji took to the stage and blew us away. Her calm, friendly, relaxed and confident demeanour impressed both the orchestra and the audience. There is something very beautiful about Ji and her violin.

Whilst churning through the 2nd violin part I got thinking. What does all this mean? What can I can take the meaning of this music? Yes it’s lyrical and melodic – but what is it’s purpose?

Here’s some background on the concerto from a historical perspective: Tchaikovsky. Depression. Disastrous marriage. Friendship. One month. Kotek. Gossip. Homosexuality. Disclosure. Dedication. Reputation.

> “How lovingly he’s busying himself with my concerto!” Tchaikovsky wrote to his brother Anatoly on the day he completed the new slow movement.

Fyi – the slow movement is horrible. Ji did her best.

## The thief in the rehearsal

Let’s back track.

This concert was beautiful but something happened during the rehearsal that shocked us all.

A thief broke in through security, listened to the first half of the rehearsal from the green room, and then left with 10 wallets and 10 phones. Who steals from musicians?

That’s right. During our 2nd last rehearsal some guy strolled in through the security doors at The Concourse. We were rehearsing on stage. He arrived, discovered his way up through the various passage ways back stage and found himself in the green room. He was in the green room. We were nearby on stage. Rehearsing Pictures by Mussorgsky.

Whilst we were battling with the gnomes he was sifting through our bags, listening to the symphony and looting. Looting cold hard cash from unsuspecting wallets and mobile phones. When he was done he ventured towards the stage.

Waiting in the wings he loitered. Luckily he was just in time for our 10 minute rehearsal break. We got up and walked straight past him, in the dark, by the side of the stage.

As the orchestra returned to the green room for some tea he stepped out into the light, onto the stage. Surprisingly he found himself alone. Not a single one of the forty+ musicians decided to stick around. We all wanted tea. He wanted more.

We sipped our tea. He sifted through various bags on stage. He lifted another bunch of wallets and phones.

By the time we all sat down to start the 2nd half of the rehearsal the police had been called to review the cctv footage.

Again. Who steals from musicians?

## You can take our wallets, but you’ll never take our Symphony!

Despite all this sexual confusion, depression and thievery – the crew pulled together and the concert remained a show stopper. Well done guys!
