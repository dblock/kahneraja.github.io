Here’s a new Nuget package I’ve put together.

A simple test and explore RESTful client for your web api 2 application, using .Net.

At work we run various web api applications. RESTful services. Lots of uri’s. Lots of contracts with client application.

To help share the knowledge of what these services do, I’ve created a web api explorer client using reflection.

This is a friendly and informative alternative to using Fiddle, Simple JS Client, the standard .Net Help page, and similar other adhoc testing / documentation tools.
