Peter Edwards' course on music composition is fascinating. It's a great refresher for anyone who has studied music theory or a fun way to discover more about how and why Mozart chose the dots that he did.

It's a 6 weeks course spanning the diatonic triad system, voice leading rules, inversions, common practices like the circle of 5ths, period form and so on.

Here's one of my first assignments.
