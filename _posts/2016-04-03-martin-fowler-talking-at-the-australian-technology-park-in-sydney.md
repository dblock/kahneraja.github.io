It was awesome to catch up with the Sydney Readify crew and see Martin Fowler talk on Microservices, Event Sourcing and Infrastructure as Code last week.

When Martin Fowler speaks, the industry listens. I learnt a lot about persuasion from listening to him speak.

It's his expertise, emotion and passion that brings a certain gravity to his technology conversation. 

He traverses commonly discussed topics in a very unique way. He starts by looking at the human, social, and scientific consequences of technology choices, design patterns and agile practices. 

Listening to him talk reminded me that working in technology is quite a privilege. Technology is often at the heart of modern successful business.

He's the sort of technologist who writes clean code not because he's an precision artist. Instead, Martin Fowler writes clean code because he is a main stream hacktivist thoughtworker.

I've been following his writing now for nearly 20 years. When I heard he was coming to Sydney I was a little star struck. I wasn't going to miss out on seeing him present.

I wasnt disappointed. If you get the chance, go and see him!
