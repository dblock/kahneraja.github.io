Grappling: OpenID Connect. Identity Server. Principal. Identity. Identity Manager.

So what are we doing here?  
We are getting started and confused. My goal was to crack open Identity Server but it seems there are some additional fundamental ideas worth exploring.

Next step  
Review if now is a good time to crack open Identity Server 3 and Identity Manager or stick with Identity Server 2 and get my head around the broader issues.
