*   [ONE SYDNEY: ART EXHIBITION & AUCTION](http://createordie.com.au/one-sydney-art-exhibition-auction/)

Art Exhibition & Auction Date: 9, Aug 2015\. 4pm to 10pm. Create or Die (Art Gallery), 10 Mitchell St, Marrickville.

Iâ€™m proud to have my work included in this weekends upcoming charity auction in aid of refugees and asylum seekers. Please come along and bring your wallet!

I dedicated these drawings to my grandmother. She was a strong woman who fled social uncertainty and violence in India to pursue independence and prosperity in Australia. Marrickville became our home and I am very proud to be part of this vibrant community.

In my work I attempt to explore the human form by looking at the judgements we form of ourselves and those around us. I hope to strip away some of these these layers to reveal a common beauty.
