## What are my top 3 strengths?

### 1. Leadership and decision making.

Working with awesome tech is great but it really does take someone with enough care about the solution to make a decision and help direct a group of talented developers.

People tell me I'm good at leadership and decision making.

### 2. Simplifying complex problems.

I listen to everyone and then I break it down so it's fun to work on. It's a combination of critical analysis and interpretation.

### 3. Learning fast.

I love writing code and learning new tech. I've been doing it since 2003.

## What does success look like?

Shopping code to production every week.

## How can I improve?

I can sometimes railroad the conversation. I'm learning how to be more patient.
