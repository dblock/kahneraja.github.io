I find that talking with business people about technical development gets weird. Are we on the same team?

Here’s an analogy that some times helps me get things moving. It’s a tennis match. Two players. A net.

## When that ball comes flying across that net, smash it back.

Developers and business manager are not on the same team. They may be working towards the same goal but their motivations and desires are orthogonal.

Often developers want clean code and creativity. Business managers want cash and value. These differences can often lead to disastisfaction and dispute.

Instead. Think fast. Come up with a solution. Get that ball. Deal with it. Send it back. Allow for that space. Allow for that conversation.
