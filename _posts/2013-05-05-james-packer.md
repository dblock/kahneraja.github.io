When I read about Packers dream of building a big fuck-off casino on Sydney harbour my stomach turns. In the media I see terms like ‘public cultural building’, ‘people-friendly community facilities’ and ‘iconic structures’ and it makes me sick.

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Whilst sitting with my aunty over the weekend she recalled the opening of The Star Sydney Casino & Hotel on 13 September 1995\. She remembers the marketing material at the time. “When the casino was opening they were promoting the revitalisation of the area.” She recalled cynically.</span>

Have you noticed how much of a slow dead pan waste land that area has become? Honestly, is there any substantial cultural development going on in the area today? Do you honestly believe a a new casino is going to keep a promise of ‘people friendly community facilities’?

In the spaces around the Star City Casino, over the past few years, I been to a number of ‘wizz bang’ weddings and visited a few cutting edges office spaces (e.g. Google) and yet it still shocks me to see how this area of the city is remains a wasteland of polished buildings and quite empty lane ways. It’s a eye sore. There is so many great local community projects that would love to use this space. Opportunities that would breathe a new life into the city.

The Star City Casino is a cost we simply can’t afford. These economic rubbish bin structures leave us with a cultural wasteland.

Dear Mr Packer, please take your casino somewhere else, we don’t need this sort of ‘opportunity’
