Musomap is a number of things.  
– a new social technology for live local music.  
– facilitates new music opportunities (world musician day, fete de la musique, popup concerts).  
– open practice rooms.  
– live local connection.  
– amateur music development.  
– creative cross genre support.  
– digital marketing.  
– community engagement.

How do I apply for an Arts NSW New Project Grant? Do I hope to host an event? Am I seeking funding to keep Musomap alive? Do I want to host a series of popup concerts? How does Arts NSW benefit from supporting Musomap?

Open community engagement and local connection (Musomap style) doesn’t exactly align with ‘good quality art’ which the the goal of these grants applications. My issue with ‘good quality’ is that it is personal and subjective.
