*   [The Roxbury Hotel, Glebe](http://roxbury.com.au/)

Last night at the Roxbury Sydney’s newest and nastiest comedy collaborative kicked off a 2hr set and we loved it! 13 comedians made their mark with a wild assortment of medical, dating and everything-in-between comedy.

Ange Hume(MC), Nathan Hughes, Gokulan Gopal, Doug Eldred, Luke McConaghey, Jack Jones, Louise Gowing, Jackson Aces, Dave Keeshan, Timothy Govers, Gearard McGeown, Reece Piper, Belle De Geurre, Lou Lou Pollard, Stephen Hoskins. Well done.

We love your shit-hot comedy guys – give us more!

It’s great to see the Roxbury Hotel celebrating live and local talent! Great venue. Great food. Great booze. This is local venues should be fun. Lots of different spaces. Lots of people.

Did you know you can use the performance space at the Roxbury (free) if you can guarantee a 20 strong audience? Note – we did have to compete with some other noises which was a little distracting for the comedians. Even with that, it’s still a great place to try out ideas and experiment new material in a friendly venue.
