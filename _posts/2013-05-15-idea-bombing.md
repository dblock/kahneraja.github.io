It’s exciting to see how Sydney has embraced this new Idea Bombing creative exchange concept! Our beloved city is beginning to find a renewed sense of pride and collaboration across the arts.

Get involved as Idea Bombing kicks off tonight!

Part meet-up, part pop-up bar, all fun: The first edition of Idea Bombing Sydney will be hosted at Alaska Projects.

Focusing on “How can your city inspire your creativity”?, it’s a night to talk, think and dream, an event for coming together to share ideas and hear about innovative projects, activities and news happening in and out of Sydney.

Presenting; Mike Smith (Cake Wines), Numbskull (street artist), John Borger (publisher), Jo & Alex (Youth Food Movement).

I’m hoping this event helps us all (especially the 1000’s of live and local musicians scattered across the city) find new ways to utilising public spaces. I walk through the city and I see so much potential down every lane and natural amphitheatre. This city is beaming with artistic talent and I’m incredibly excited about how the team behind Idea Bombing are bring people together to create the change we so desperately need!
