My partner and I have this thing we do when our friends get married. We play duets.

Often we perform during the ceremony, whilst the bride walks down the aisle. Other times we provide chilled classical background music at the reception. More often than not it’s a little wedding gift for friends, a performance we can bring to the celebrations! I’m sure I’ve done over 200 different weddings by now.

On the weekend we helped out with Bride and Harry’s beautiful wedding at Balmoral Beach Bathers club. Congrats guys!

If anyone would like our home made book of ‘Tiger & Panda Duets’ please get in touch ![:)](http://www.kahneraja.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png) It’s 25 arrangements of regular quartets and a few other fun things.
