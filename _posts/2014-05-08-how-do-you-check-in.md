It’s interesting to work with different development teams. Everyone has a different way of working, and it all comes to a head when we checkin our code.

Here’s my take on the different types of version control aware software people ![:)](http://www.kahneraja.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)

_Give. Get. Merge…_

### Addicted.

You want to check-in all the time. You fix typos and check them in. You check-in files that haven’t changed.

You’re obsessed with getting the latest. Half way through writing a line of code you’ll get latest just in case something happened whilst you were doing some actual work.

### Cowboy.

You get drunk and start checking stuff just to see what’ll happen. And you never get latest.

“Yep! I’ll auto merge all those changes thanks :)”.

### Performer.

You’re perfect. Every time you check-in the world starts clapping.

### Shy.

Your palms go sweating every time you check-in. You shy away from the Commit button and bury yourself in another 2hrs of unit tests.

### Explorer.

You don’t bother with the IDE. Who needs that?

No. You get the file explorer add-ons and starting checking in system files that have nothing to do with the solution.

### Comparer.

You don’t checkin or check out. You just sit there and watch the history. You compare. Ready to pounce.
