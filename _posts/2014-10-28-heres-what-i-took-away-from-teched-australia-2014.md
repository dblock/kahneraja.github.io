Microsoft has done a first class job with building an end to end cloud service offer. I would happily recommend Azure to both the big and the small end of town.

Scott Guthrie’s keynote was one of the highlight for me. At the opening presentation he announced the arrival of Azure in Australia and outlined why this is such a big deal for all of us. Having an Azure data centre based in Australia makes it possible for us to deliver faster solutions that fall within national regulations. We can now use Azure to build large scale solutions for local banks and the federal government.

I’ve written endless notes on the 15+ talks I attended. Each talk was extremely well presented, entertaining and educational.Here are my top 5 tag to summarise TechEd 2014.

### #Cloud. #ContinuousDelivery. #Mobile. #IOT. #OpenSource.

It was an absolute privilege to see the outstanding collection of speakers, spend time with my Readify colleagues and meet other friends across the industry. It’s great to be in a room with so many talented developers, testers, administrators, managers, specialists, and consultants. I look forward to seeing you all again very soon.
